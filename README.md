## Introduction
This project visualizes the distribution of ages in a population using a histogram. The aim is to provide a clear and informative graphical representation of age distribution.

## Importing Libaries
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

## Using the data needed

## Exploratory data analysis 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
